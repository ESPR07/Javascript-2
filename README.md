## Description
Javascript involved building a social media site and adding functionalities normally found on social media pages. we had 6 weeks to develop all neccessary key points asked of us. The site has been made using Bootstrap, SASS and Javascript. We also imlemented the use of JSDocs for documenting functions in Javascript. The development proccess was also in focus as we were to plan the project in advance using trello or similar tools and then recieve feedback from both peers and teachers using pull requests.

Project's key points:
- Creating an appealing front-end client using any chosen language.
- Developing a system that allows users to register a new user to the site.
- Developing a system that allows users to login using the credentials registered on their account.
- Displaying a feed showing all posts that exists on the API.
- Give the user the ability to filter and search for posts.
- Let the user view individual posts.
- Let a logged in user post, edit or delete a post.
